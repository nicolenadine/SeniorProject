intro_paragraph = """
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used in malware 
classification due to their ability to extract meaningful patterns from 
visual representations of malware binaries. These binaries, essentially byte 
streams, can be transformed into grayscale images for analysis. However, 
CNNs come with a high computational cost, which grows with image and dataset 
size. This project explores segment-based CNN training as an alternative. By 
training on image segments instead of full images, this project aims to 
maintain classification performance while reducing computational overhead.

The confusion matrix provides a detailed view of how well the model is
